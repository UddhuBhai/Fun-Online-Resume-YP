# 😂 Yatharth Poonia's Legendary Resume

Welcome to the **official, totally legit, and not-at-all suspicious** online resume of **Yatharth Poonia** — a man of mystery, memes, and *mildly impressive* accomplishments.

This website is hosted via GitHub Pages and was made for fun. It’s a light-hearted take on a traditional resume, with a sprinkle of humor and a whole lotta love. 💼🎉
